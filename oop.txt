	OOP (Object Oriented Programming) 

	OOP : Black Box 

	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer 		programming model that organizes software design 	around 	data, or objects, rather than functions 	and logic. An 	object can be defined as a data 	field that has unique 	attributes and behavior.


	Types of OOP.

	There are 4 Types or Pillars or Features of OOP

	1) Encapsulation
	2) Inheritance
	3) Polymorphism
	4) Data Abstraction



	A) Encapsulation :

	- It is wrapping up of data into a single unit.

	e.g capsule

	- class and object.

	Class : It contains Data Members and Member 		Functions with some behavioural change.

	Object : It is an instance of a class.

	e.g papercup

	B) Inheritance  (is-a ) relationship
	
	- It is acquiring the property of base 		class/parent  class into the derived class/child 	class.

	Types of Inheritance : There are 5 types

	1)Single-level Inheritance
	2)Multi-level Inheritance
	3)Multiple -level Inheritance
	4) Hierarchical - level Inheritance
	5) Hybrid - level Inheritance

	C) Polymorphism :

	Poly -> Many  
	morphism - > Forms

	-It is a combination of Many Forms

	There are 2 Types of Polymorphism

	1) Compile-Time Polymorphism
		e.g Method overloading

	2) Run- Time Polymorphism
		e.g Method Overriding


	Data Abstraction :

	It is hiding the internal implementation and 		showing	the essential detail.
